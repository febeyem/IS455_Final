IS 445 - Data Visualization

# Final Project

My biggest takeaway from this class is that there are many different libraries in python that can help you create stunning visualizations. Doing the weekly visualizations assignment has taught me that your visualization can always be further improved. When I was knitpicking through the different visualizations, you have to understand who your audience is and how simple/complex you want to make your visualizaiton. I think the more visually stunning it is, the less comprehension the general public may have. Another aspect I realized is that some people may have a disability when it comes to their vision so it also made me think of otherways to "visualize" or sense data and even if that is possible through another sense like touching a 3D model of a visualization.

Some things that could be improved on in this class is using another method besides python. I think learning dashboard tools like Tableau or Power BI would be so so so beneficial. I see it all the time in job descriptions for "data analyst" or "data engineer" and it made me wish that we got a basic understanding of these tools through this class. Also showing how to visualize using R or even some of the basic visualization tools within excel would be nice.
